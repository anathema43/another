## üåê **Section 2: Initial Deployment (Avoiding Razorpay)**

### **Step 1: Prepare for Deployment**
```bash
# 1. Test production build locally
npm run build
npm run preview
# Should open at http://localhost:4173

# 2. Verify build works without errors
# Check that all pages load correctly in preview mode
```

### **Step 2: Configure Netlify Environment Variables**

#### **Set Placeholder for Razorpay:**
```env
# In Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables:

# Firebase Configuration (use your real values)
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id

# Razorpay (use placeholder initially)
VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_placeholder

# Optional services (use placeholders)
VITE_ALGOLIA_APP_ID=placeholder
VITE_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_KEY=placeholder
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=placeholder
```

#### **Why This Works:**
- The application will load and function normally
- Users can browse, add to cart, and reach checkout
- Payment section will show "Payment configuration pending" message
- No errors or crashes occur

### **Step 3: Deploy to Netlify**

#### **Option A: GitHub Integration (Recommended)**
```bash
# 1. Push your code to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for initial deployment"
git push origin main

# 2. In Netlify Dashboard:
# - Click "New site from Git"
# - Choose GitHub and authorize
# - Select your repository
# - Build settings:
#   Build command: npm run build
#   Publish directory: dist
# - Add environment variables (from Step 2)
# - Deploy site
```

#### **Option B: Manual Deploy**
```bash
# 1. Build the project
npm run build

# 2. Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# 3. Login and deploy
netlify login
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### **Step 4: Test Deployed Site**
```bash
# Visit your Netlify URL (e.g., https://amazing-name-123456.netlify.app)

‚úÖ Test the same user journey as local:
- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] Products display correctly
- [ ] User registration/login works
- [ ] Cart functionality works
- [ ] Checkout process works up to payment screen
- [ ] Payment screen shows appropriate message about configuration

# This confirms your site is production-ready except for payment processing
```

## üîÑ **Section 3: Switching from Test to Production**

### **Understanding Test vs Production Environment**

#### **Test Environment:**
- Uses Razorpay test API keys (start with `rzp_test_`)
- Processes fake payments that don't charge real money
- Perfect for testing complete payment flow
- Test cards: 4111111111111111 (success), 4000000000000002 (failure)

#### **Production Environment:**
- Uses Razorpay live API keys (start with `rzp_live_`)
- Processes real payments with real money
- Requires completed business verification
- Only switch when ready for real customers

### **Criteria for Going Live**

#### **‚úÖ Ready to Switch When:**
- [ ] Razorpay account is fully verified and approved
- [ ] You have received live API keys from Razorpay
- [ ] You've tested the complete flow with test keys
- [ ] You're ready to accept real customer orders
- [ ] Customer service processes are in place
- [ ] You have inventory ready to ship

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Don't Switch If:**
- [ ] Still testing the application
- [ ] Razorpay account verification is pending
- [ ] You don't have inventory or fulfillment ready
- [ ] Customer service processes aren't established

### **Step-by-Step "Go Live" Process**

#### **Phase 1: Update Frontend (Netlify)**
```bash
# 1. Get your live Razorpay Key ID from Razorpay Dashboard
# Go to: https://dashboard.razorpay.com/app/keys
# Copy the "Key Id" that starts with "rzp_live_"

# 2. Update Netlify Environment Variables
# Go to: Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Your Site ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
# Find: VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID
# Update value to: rzp_live_your_actual_live_key_id

# 3. Trigger Netlify Redeploy
# In Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Deploys ‚Üí Trigger deploy ‚Üí Deploy site
# Wait for deployment to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)
```

#### **Phase 2: Update Backend (Firebase Functions)**
```bash
# 1. Install Firebase CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login

# 2. Update Firebase Functions Configuration
firebase functions:config:set razorpay.key_id="rzp_live_your_live_key_id"
firebase functions:config:set razorpay.key_secret="your_live_key_secret"

# 3. Verify Configuration
firebase functions:config:get
# Should show your updated Razorpay configuration

# 4. Deploy Updated Functions
cd functions
npm install
firebase deploy --only functions

# 5. Verify Deployment
firebase functions:log
# Check for any deployment errors
```

#### **Phase 3: Update Webhook URL (Critical)**
```bash
# 1. Go to Razorpay Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Webhooks
# 2. Update webhook URL to your production domain:
#    https://your-region-your-project.cloudfunctions.net/razorpayWebhook
# 3. Ensure events are selected: payment.captured, payment.failed
# 4. Save webhook configuration
```

#### **Phase 4: Production Testing**
```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Test with small amounts first (‚Çπ10-50)

# 1. Visit your live site
# 2. Complete a real purchase with a small amount
# 3. Use your real debit/credit card
# 4. Verify order appears in admin panel
# 5. Check email notifications are sent
# 6. Confirm payment appears in Razorpay dashboard

‚úÖ Success Criteria:
- [ ] Real payment processes successfully
- [ ] Order is created in your database
- [ ] Customer receives order confirmation email
- [ ] Payment appears in Razorpay dashboard
- [ ] Admin can see order in admin panel
```

### **Production Testing Commands**
```bash
# Monitor Firebase Functions logs during testing
firebase functions:log --only createRazorpayOrder

# Check for any errors during payment processing
firebase functions:log --only verifyRazorpayPayment

# Monitor webhook processing
firebase functions:log --only razorpayWebhook
```

### **Rollback Plan (If Issues Occur)**
```bash
# If production payment fails, quickly rollback:

# 1. Revert Netlify environment variable
VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_your_test_key

# 2. Revert Firebase Functions config
firebase functions:config:set razorpay.key_id="rzp_test_your_test_key"
firebase functions:config:set razorpay.key_secret="your_test_secret"

# 3. Redeploy functions
firebase deploy --only functions

# 4. Update webhook URL back to test mode
# This gives you time to debug issues without affecting customers
```
